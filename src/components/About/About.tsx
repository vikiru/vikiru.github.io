                        My journey into the world of software development began
                        with an introduction to computer science and
                        programming, utilizing languages such as C++ and Java.
                        Following that, my university degree at Carleton
                        University provided me with a strong foundation of
                        knowledge and exposure to various languages, including
                        Racket, C, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and
                        SQL.
                        <br /> After graduating, my goal has been to continue
                        learning and growing as a software developer. I actively
                        seek out new and meaningful projects to challenge
                        myself, working with both familiar and unfamiliar
                        technologies. My journey into web development has been
                        particularly rewarding, where Iâ€™ve enjoyed working with
                        technologies such as React, TailwindCSS, and Express.
                        <br /> I love creating software, no matter the platform.
                        The process of refining a rough idea into something
                        polished and functional through iterative development
                        excites me. I am particularly drawn to projects where
                        the end product is easily accessible to anyone,
                        regardless of their device, ensuring a wide-reaching
                        impact.
